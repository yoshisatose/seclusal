This is to get Yoshi's insights into medium blog article with code notebooks.
Then perhaps work on a more mathematcal description.

The plan is for Yoshi to own this for open dessimation with Raaz and Benny as a potential academic output in the future.

Currently the draft is manned by Yoshi with Raaz support in Overleaf until Benny is free after Xmas.

We will eventually move everything here carefully before a public release.
